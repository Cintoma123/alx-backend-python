# alx-backend-python

This project demonstrates efficient backend data processing in Python, focusing on memory-efficient techniques for handling large datasets and integrating with MySQL databases.

# Features

- **MySQL Database Connectivity:** Easily connect and interact with a MySQL database.
- **Data Streaming:** Use generators to process large CSV files or database records one at a time.
- **Batch Processing:** Insert or process data in batches for better performance and scalability.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Avoid loading entire datasets into memory, making the code suitable for big data tasks.
